# Natural-Language-Processing

This repository includes the projects I completed in the course DATA130030 of Fudan University. It contains three single person projects and one group project. 

+ Project1: Using [enwiki_20220201](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/20220201/),  complete basic data analysis, and implement NGram and naive Bayesian classifiers.
+ Project2: Still using enwiki_20220201,  train word embeddings using SGNS and generate document embedding.
+ Project3: Built the most frequent tagger and HMM tagger for a Brown corpus.
+ Final Project: We choose [SemEval-2020 Task 4 Subtask A](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080).

All projects have reached a very high completion and excellent level. See readme under each project for detailed project introduction.
